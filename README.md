## **Wireframes**

### **User Story**
    
As a student who is considering 1-to-1 IELTS online tuition, I want:

1. Information presented in a clear and easy to understand English.
2. Information about the tutor’s experience with the IELTS exam.
3. Examples of the tutor’s teaching materials.
4. Information about the tutor’s method and style of teaching.
5. The ability to find the exact cost of lessons.
6. The ability to communicate to the tutor my exact goals and what I need to improve.

**Design Choices**

The overall design of the site was based on clarity and simplicity. As this is a site aimed at English as a foreign language (EFL) students, information is presented as clearly as possible without any distracting backgrounds and simple clear colour schemes.
The following design choices were made with this in mind:

* **Font**

Only one font is used throughout the site and that is Open Sans, which was chosen for its readability in headings and smaller texts.

* **Colours**

The colour palette of the site revolves around the dark blue background of the hero-image. Uploading the hero-image to a colour gradient generator allowed for the footer background colour to match stylistically so that the colour is represented on every page. 
```
background: linear-gradient(105deg, rgba(50, 116, 166, 1) 0%, rgba(2, 34, 59, 1) 100%)
```

Any text that laid over the background colour was given the colour of 'Aliceblue' to contrast it. The download button on the homepage was given a red colour to stand out against the blue background while matching the red diagonal stripe that goes through the hero image.

### **Bugs**

### Solved Issues 

1. On the homepage the sub-heading was too close to the centre of the hero-imgfrom resolutions widths of 452px up to 719 px  and was being slightly obscured by the shadow on the image. 

![Screenshot of subtitle placement issue](assets/images/screenshots/screenshot-subtitle-issue.png)

The cause of the issue was that the media query  set up to move the subheading below the center of the hero image was only set up for tablet resolutions and above. 

![Screenshot of issue]()

The media query was changed to incorporate resolutions from width from 452 and above screen sizes to fix the issue.


2. The IELTS 1-1 logo in the footer when hovered over would turn blue therefore making it difficult to read on the. blue background of the footer. The issue being that even though text-decoration was set to none, the colour was still set to the default blue for links. 

![Screenshot of issue](assets/images/screenshots/screenshot-footer-hover-issue.png)

The solution was to target the footer id and the hover pseudo class and add the following CSS code

    ```
    #footer>a:hover {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: aliceblue}
    ```

3.  The most significant issue related to the buttons in the learn more section on the homepage. Early on I ran into the problem that because the text above the buttons was of differing length, the horizontal alignment of the buttons would not match due to the content above it.
    The first step I took to solve this issue was instead of using a simple bootstrap 3-column layout, I utilised the bootstrap card-deck component to help with the responsiveness. However the issue was still apparent.

![Screenshot of issue](assets/images/screenshots/screenshot-button-issue.png)

The issue was finally solved with the help of the code institute tutor support and the use of a min-height for each card body and positioning the buttons absolutely at the bottom of each card body. 
 

``` .btn-blue {
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, 0);
}
```

Then media queries were used to ensure that at each breakpoint in which the cards where horizontally aligned there was enough space for the buttons to remain horizontally aligned and not overlap with the text above them.  
```
@media screen and (min-width:1440px) {
    section-details .card-body {
        min-height: 300px;
    }

    .btn-blue {
        position: absolute;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate(-50%, 0);
        bottom: 100px
    }
}
```

4. One bug noted during the testing period was that the contents of the about me page were not taking up 100% of the width of the viewport meaning that on mobile and desktop there was always a small empty space to the right of all of the containers. When scrolling on mobile this became particularly notable. This bug was not present on any of the other pages. 

![screenshot of issue](assets/images/screenshots/about-page-container-issue.png)

The issue was solved by going through each element on the page in chrome developer tools and locating which element was causing the overspill. As the screenshot above shows, the element causing the issue was the row above the three columns for the student testimonials.

To solve the issue I separated the section heading and the three columns into their own containers and rows as shown in the code snippet below. 
```
<header class="container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <h2 class="text-center section-heading">What my students say</h2>
            </div>
        </div>
    </header>
    <section class="container-fluid bottom-section">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg testimonials">
```
